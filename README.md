# ETL Data Pipeline Project
﻿
## Project Description
This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using **Python**, **SQL**, and **MySQL**. The pipeline involves extracting data from multiple sources (CSV files, APIs), transforming and cleaning the data, and loading it into a **MySQL** database. 
﻿
## Features
- **Data Extraction**: 
- Fetch data from CSV files (simulated sales data).
- Can be extended to pull data from APIs or other data sources.
  
- **Data Transformation**:
- Clean and preprocess data using **pandas** (e.g., handling missing values, converting data types).
- Perform complex transformations (e.g., aggregating sales by region, calculating total sales).
  
- **Data Loading**:
- Store the cleaned data in a **MySQL** database.
- Use **SQLAlchemy** to interact with the database and load data.
